To compute the surface area of a cube using a shell script, you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to calculate surface area of a cube
calculate_surface_area() {
    side_length=$1

    # Calculate surface area
    surface_area=$(echo "6 * $side_length * $side_length" | bc)
    echo "Surface Area of the cube with side length $side_length units: $surface_area square units"
}

# Taking user input for side length
read -p "Enter the side length of the cube: " side_length

# Calling the function to calculate surface area
calculate_surface_area $side_length
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `calculate_cube_surface_area.sh`, and make it executable using:

```bash
chmod +x calculate_cube_surface_area.sh
```

You can then run the script and enter the side length of the cube to calculate its surface area.
