To compute the area of a rectangle using a shell script, you can use the following script:
#!/bin/bash

# Function to calculate area of rectangle
calculate_area() {
    length=$1
    breadth=$2

    # Calculate area
    area=$(echo "$length * $breadth" | bc)
    echo "Area of rectangle: $area"
}

# Taking user input for length and breadth
read -p "Enter the length of the rectangle: " length
read -p "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: " breadth

# Calling the function to calculate area
calculate_area $length $breadth




###Save this script to a file, for example, `calculate_rectangle_area.sh`, and make it executable using:
chmod +x calculate_rectangle_area.sh
You can then run the script and enter the length and breadth of the rectangle to calculate its area.
